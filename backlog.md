# OIE Backlog

- [ ] Add a test suite
- [ ] Improve Grafana dashboards (fix “Top” items, general cleanup)
- [ ] Add a config file (reduce flag count)
- [ ] Make internal heuristics overrideable (thresholds/weights/bands via config) - maybe
- [ ] Reduce noisy state-change logs
- [ ] Keep collection cadence consistent (no drift)
